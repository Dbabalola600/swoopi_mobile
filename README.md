## Submission by Babalola Damisi


this was built using react native expo with typescript 

## Technologies used 
- twrnc (for styling )
- zustand (for handling to cart)


## Execution 
- users can enter the application and select from the home page which store to select

- upon selecting a store they can add items to the basket 

- to view a basket either click on a store from the home page or click the top right icon 

## Issues faced
- the api provided didn't return an expected value so i copied the json into a mock data file to use accordingly 

- getting the right image size for the splash screen

- Testing was done using an apple device not an andriod
